/*  Test prepared by Mark Rice: mrice@canarylabs.com
    Description: MaxAge > Int32. Perform 2 reads where each read has a MaxAge > Int32. Request both Server and Source timestamps.
        The cached value ServerTimestamp should update, but the SourceTimestamp should not – if the value hasn’t changed
    Expectation: ServiceResult = “Good”. Ideally, the server will return a cached value, but it may obtain and return a new value from the Device. If
        the SourceTimestamp was the same on both reads, the second value, at least, was probably from the cache. [Warning issued if no caching) */
