/*    Test 5.7.1-21 prepared by Dale Pope dale.pope@matrikon.com
      Description:
          Given five nodes to browse
            And the nodes exist
            And the nodes have at least two forward references
          When Browse is called
          Then the server returns a continuation point for each node
            And all preceding operation results are Good
          Note: it is OK to use the same node over and over (as this script does)
          because the ContinuationPoint will be unique for each. */
